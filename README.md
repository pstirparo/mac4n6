# Mac4n6 Group

Interested in Mac OS X and iOS Forensics? We are collecting and maintaining a list of mac4n6 resources.


## Artifacts
The idea is to create one single point of collection for OS X and iOS artifacts location, trying to collect more information for each artifact, not just a path!

The motto? Reusable format. 
The goal is that the information collected have to be “machine parsable” and mostly “human readable/writable”, reusable by any application, library, etc. (am I too optimistic?). That is why as main collaboration tool for the collection, we use a shared spreadsheet so that anyone can add new artifacts, there is no need to know how to code to contribute to this project (so, no excuses!).
From here, two (simple) scripts will convert the csv file into:
* yaml artifact library file, so that other applications can use it. No crapy/fancy xml things.
* ForensicsWiki page, one of the point of reference for forensics practitioners.

This way the effort is centralized and made only once.



### Mac OS X Forensics Artifacts
Here is the shared spreadsheet for the OSX artifacts:

Here is the link to the ForensicsWiki page updated from the above spreadsheet

* https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.11_(ElCapitan)_-_Artifacts_Location


### iOS Forensics Artifacts
Here is the shared spreadsheet for the iOS artifacts (way too much initial phase still):
